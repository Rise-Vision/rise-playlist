# Rise Page Web Component

## Introduction
`rise-page` is a Polymer Web Component that works with [Rise Vision](https://www.risevision.com/), the digital signage management application for [Web Designers](http://risevision.com/web-designers). It controls the playback of its nested playlists, and surfaces methods for returning details about the Display.

Playlist items that have the same duration and are located in the same position within a playlist as another playlist item within a separate playlist, will have their playback synchronized.

Consider the following HTML snippet:
```
<rise-page id="page" display-id="abc123">
  <rise-playlist id="playlist-1" intro="fade-in" outro="fade-out">
    <rise-playlist-item duration="3">
      <demo-component id="apple" src="https://url.to.apple.png"></demo-component>
    </rise-playlist-item>
    <rise-playlist-item duration="5">
      <demo-component id="duck" src="https://url.to.duck.png"></demo-component>
    </rise-playlist-item>
  </rise-playlist>
  <rise-playlist id="playlist-2" intro="fade-in" outro="fade-out">
    <rise-playlist-item duration="3">
      <demo-component id="balloons" src="https://url.to.balloons.png"></demo-component>
    </rise-playlist-item>
    <rise-playlist-item duration="5">
      <demo-component id="moon" src="https://url.to.moon.png"></demo-component>
    </rise-playlist-item>
  </rise-playlist>
</rise-page>
```

In the above example, `apple` and `balloons` both play for 3 seconds. After that, `duck` and `moon` play for 5 seconds. In this way, both playlists are synchronized such that they start and end at the exact same time.

### Distribution
The [distribution component](https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-distribution) can be used to control whether or not a Playlist shows on a Display. If any of the values in its `distribution` attribute match the value of the page component's `display-id` attribute, the playlist will play. Otherwise, the playlist will be hidden from view and will not play.

In the following example, `playlist-1` will play since it has a distribution that matches that of the page component, while `playlist-2` will be skipped as none of its distributions match.
```
<rise-page id="page" display-id="abc123">
  <rise-playlist id="playlist-1" intro="fade-in" outro="fade-out">
    <rise-playlist-item duration="3">
      <demo-component id="apple" src="https://url.to.apple.png"></demo-component>
    </rise-playlist-item>
    <rise-distribution distribution='[{"id":"abc123"}]'></rise-distribution>
  </rise-playlist>
  <rise-playlist id="playlist-2" intro="fade-in" outro="fade-out">
    <rise-playlist-item duration="5">
      <demo-component id="duck" src="https://url.to.duck.png"></demo-component>
    </rise-playlist-item>
    <rise-distribution distribution='[{"id":"dummy-id"},{"id":"no-match"}]'></rise-distribution>
  </rise-playlist>
</rise-page>
```

In addition, `rise-page` surfaces methods for returning details about the Display.

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

## Usage
To begin, you will need to install the following components using Bower:
```
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-page.git
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-playlist.git
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-playlist-item.git
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-distribution.git
```

The above repositories, as well as their dependencies, are installed in the `bower_components` folder.

Next, construct your HTML page. You should include `webcomponents-lite.min.js` before any code that touches the DOM, and load the web component using an HTML import. For example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/rise-page/rise-page.html">
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/rise-playlist/rise-playlist.html">
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/rise-playlist-item/rise-playlist-item.html">
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/rise-distribution/rise-distribution.html">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Replace "abc123" with a valid Display ID. -->
    <rise-page id="page" display-id="abc123">
      <rise-playlist id="playlist-1">
        <rise-playlist-item duration="5">
          <!-- Content goes here. -->
        </rise-playlist-item>
        <rise-distribution distribution='[{"id":"abc123"}]'></rise-distribution>
      </rise-playlist>
    </rise-page>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Building Custom Content
When building custom content for use with `rise-page`, there are a few conventions that must be followed.

The first is that your content must dispatch the `rise-component-ready` event once the component has initialized and is ready for display. This event takes as a parameter an object of the following form:
```
{
  "detail": {
    "play": playFunction,
    "pause": pauseFunction,
    "stop": stopFunction,
    "done": true|false
  }
}
```

where `playFunction`, `pauseFunction` and `stopFunction` are references to the functions to call when the content component is played, paused or stopped, respectively. `done` is a boolean value that indicates whether or not the component supports play until done.

The following code will dispatch this event:
```
var readyEvent = new CustomEvent("rise-component-ready", {
  "detail": {
    "play": this.play,
    "pause": this.pause,
    "stop": this.stop,
    "done": true
  },
  "bubbles": true
});

this.dispatchEvent(readyEvent);
```

Additionally, if your content supports play until done, it must dispatch the `rise-component-done` event once a full playback cycle has completed. This event takes no parameters.

The following code will dispatch this event:
```
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("rise-component-done", { "bubbles": true }));
```

A sample child component that is built as a web component can be seen [here](https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-page/blob/master/demo/demo-component.html). You will need to replace the `display-id` attribute of the `<rise-page>` element with a valid Display ID in order to return data.
