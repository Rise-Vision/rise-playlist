# Rise Playlist Web Component

## Introduction
`rise-playlist` is a Polymer Web Component that works with [Rise Vision](https://www.risevision.com/), the digital signage management application for [Web Designers](http://risevision.com/web-designers). Its purpose is to rotate between different pieces of content on an HTML page.

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

## Usage
To begin, you will need to install the following components using Bower:

```
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-page.git
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-playlist.git
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-playlist-item.git
```

Next, construct your HTML page. You should include `webcomponents-lite.min.js` before any code that touches the DOM, and load the web components using HTML imports. For example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/rise-page/rise-page.html">
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/rise-playlist/rise-playlist.html">
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/rise-playlist-item/rise-playlist-item.html">
  </head>
  <body>
    <rise-page id="page" display-id="your-display-id">
      <rise-playlist id="playlist" intro="fade-in" outro="fade-out">
        <rise-playlist-item duration="3">
          <!-- Content components go here -->
        </rise-playlist-item>
      </rise-playlist>
    </rise-page>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Building Content Components
When building a content component for use with `rise-playlist`, you must dispatch the `rise-component-ready` event once the component has initialized and is ready for display. This event takes as a parameter an object of the following form:
```
{
  "detail": {
    "play": playFunction,
    "pause": pauseFunction,
    "stop": stopFunction,
    "done": true|false
  }
}
```

where `playFunction`, `pauseFunction` and `stopFunction` are references to the functions to call when the content component is played, paused or stopped, respectively. `done` is a boolean value that indicates whether or not the component supports play until done. For example, the following code will dispatch this event:
```
var readyEvent = new CustomEvent("rise-component-ready", {
  "detail": {
    "play": this.play,
    "pause": this.pause,
    "stop": this.stop,
    "done": true
  },
  "bubbles": true
});

this.dispatchEvent(readyEvent);
```

The component has 30 seconds in which to initialize and dispatch the `rise-component-ready` event. After that, only components that have reported as ready will display. Components that are skipped will have their playlist item duration (if specified) added to the duration of the subsequent playlist item.

If a component supports play until done, it must dispatch the `rise-component-done` event once a full playback cycle has completed. This event takes no parameters. For example, the following code will dispatch this event:
```
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("rise-component-done", { "bubbles": true }));
```

## Development

### Dependencies
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is used to manage our source code on Github.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) & [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - npm is the default package manager for Node.js. npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application. These dependencies are listed in the _package.json_ file.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Bower is a package manager for Javascript libraries and frameworks. All third-party Javascript dependencies are listed in the _bower.json_ file.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a Javascript task runner. It lints, runs unit and E2E (end-to-end) tests, minimizes files, etc. Gulp tasks are defined in _gulpfile.js_.
* [Polyserve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyserve) - A simple web server for using bower components locally.

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
To make changes to the web component, you'll first need to install the dependencies:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js and npm](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/65463770933/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower) - To install Bower, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g bower`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g bower`.
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) - To install Gulp, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g gulp`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g gulp`.
- [Polyserve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyserve) - To install Polyserve, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g polyserve`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g polyserve`.


The web component can now be installed by executing the following commands in Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-playlist.git
cd rise-playlist
npm install
bower install
```

### Run Locally
To access the demo locally, run the `polyserve` command in Terminal.

In your browser, navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/components/rise-playlist/demo/
```

### Testing
You can run the suite of tests from the command line or via a local web server using Polyserve.

#### Command Line
Execute the following command in Terminal to run the tests:
```
gulp test
```

#### Local Server
Run the `polyserve` command in Terminal.

In your browser, navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/components/rise-playlist/test/
```

### Deployment
Once you are satisifed with your changes, deploy `rise-playlist.html`, as well as the `polymer`, `webcomponentsjs`, `underscore` and `rise-playlist-item` folders to your server. You can then use the web component by following the *Usage* instructions above.
